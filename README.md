## Hello there üëã 

  

My name is Daniel Alejandro Roa Palacios, and this is my Github account, I have been a little bit absent recently (I'm focusing in finish my degree), but you can find some of my works that I have developed for my university and some personal projects, I have been codding since 2017 and these are the current programming languages that I know: 

  

- Java (most of my repositories) 

- Python (cool for AI and Data science) 

- JavaScript (I'm improving with web pages)
